# MIMO-Communication
Designing multiple input multiple output communication setups with nRF modules and Arduino

Project Summary

This project demonstrates practical implementation of MIMO-style communication using NRF24L01+ RF modules and Arduino Uno boards. The system simulates parallel wireless links using multiple RF pipes, addressable nodes, and basic timing coordination. Through this, it explores key concepts in wireless protocol design such as node synchronization, multi-node transmission handling, and data integrity over RF.

The project highlights a hands-on understanding of low-level RF communication, embedded programming, and scalable network design. It serves as a strong foundation for developing distributed sensor systems, custom wireless protocols, or more advanced IoT applications using resource-constrained hardware.

Designed with simplicity and reproducibility in mind, this work reflects both practical circuit integration and thoughtful software design â€” key skills in embedded systems and electronics prototyping.
